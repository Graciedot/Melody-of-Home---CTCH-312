---> GUIDE
-
Because Melody of Home is a narrative based game, there is some linearity to the gameplay that the player has to follow in order to progress and achieve the next piece of story. 

After the first cutscene, the player is given an 
---> OBJECTIVE
Find 3 sprites and successfully build gain their trust

What this means is, the player has to look around the map for 3 different sprites, interact with them, and complete their rhythm game. Every single sprite has their own unique beatmap; however, in order to progress, the player has to successfully pass all 3 beatmaps. 

---> RHYTHM MECHANICS
The beatmaps function by utilizing the ‘DF JK’ keys, and the game itself provides a small signifier that indicates this — alongside an extra 10 second intro — to help prepare the player for the game.

---> PASS OR FAIL
The player will know they have passed when they receive both a ‘PASS’ in the results menu after the rhythm game, as well as a cutscene that follows the beatmap. If the player does not, they will spawn beside the sprite where they can re-enter and try again.


---> BOSS FIGHT
Once all 3 beatmaps are passed, the player will spawn back into the world, where they will then be taken to a new cutscene that brings them to the boss fight. Like the sprites, the boss fight is also a rhythm game; however the difficulty is increased for this particular beatmap.
If the beatmap is not passed, the beatmap will restart until the player successfully passes it. Because they are locked in a major story plot point, they can not return to the 3D world map.
Once the player passes the Boss battle, the game will enter a new cutscene that results in the player having to pick one out of 2 choices.

---> CHOICES
Both choices have cutscenes attached to them that are different from each other. Depending on which the player chooses ultimately decides the ending of the story. In the event that the player wishes to choose the other ending, they will have to replay the entire story over again.

---> CREDITS
At the end is the credits scene, which can then be exited through ALT + F4, or by pressing Escape, enabling the menu that allows the player to quit at any moment.

===> CONVENIENCY
If the player is doing a re-run or is stuck at one of the first level rhythm games, they always have the option to skip cutscenes which will immediately bring them to the next scene. This can help speed up the game if the player does not wish to read the dialogue multiple times.

===? IN CASE OF BUGS
-
 Aria Walking: Aria is a little nervous sometimes and has a propensity for jittering while they walk. This is completely normal and is generally not something to worry about.
IN OTHER WORDS: There is a strange jittering accompanied by the walking function. It has the potential to belong to the camera; however, there is no current answer as to why Aria Jitters

Rock Collisions: Walking through the rocks is NOT concerning. The collisions on the rocks liked to shrink them drastically, therefore the decision to not include these collisions had to be made.
We are also not sure why this occurred…
