/* 
*	BeatScroller.cs (Rhythm Game Script)
*	<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
*	
*	This script controls the beat scroller object, which contains all of our notes, making them slowly scroll
*	towards the coloured buttons located at the bottom edge of the screen.
*	
*	It uses a pre-entered song tempo (which SHOULD be the same bpm as the audio track we're using if
*	we don't want any timing issues!) to determine how quickly it should move. It then moves the object
*	it is attached to every frame by that amount accordingly.
*	
*	It was set up to be started by the IntroManager script in the event we wanted cutscenes inside the
*	rhythm game scenes; however, we ended up just giving it the 'okay' to start as soon as it loads alongside having 
*	a timer count down the seconds until the beat scroller arrives at the buttons.
